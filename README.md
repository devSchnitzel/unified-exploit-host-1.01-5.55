## Unified Al-Azif Exploit Host for PS4 (1.01 - 5.53-01)

# NOTE : Al-Azif Exploit Host now works on 5.53-01, changes needed were made. (12/05/18)

## Double note : IT IS NOT AN KEXPLOIT, IT IS ONLY AN EXPLOIT HOST, so the 5.50 to 5.53-01 Webkit exploit made by Ciss84 is REAL, but it is only an WEBKIT exploit ATM.

Exploit Host made by Al-Azif, source code here : https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host

Thanks to everyone who made webkit exploits and kexploits at the same time (they know themselves, thanks for making this scene alive :) )

Older 4.55 payloads are on this release.

# To-Do : Need to wait for Specter's full 5.05 Kernel exploit launch to include it in this release.
