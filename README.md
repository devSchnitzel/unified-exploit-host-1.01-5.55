## Unified Al-Azif Exploit Host for PS4 (1.01 - 5.55)

# NOTE : Al-Azif Exploit Host now works on 5.55, changes needed were made.

Exploit Host made by Al-Azif, source code here : https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host

Thanks to everyone who made webkit exploits and kexploits at the same time (they know themselves, thanks for making this scene alive :) )

Older 4.55 payloads are on this release.

Added 5.05 OpenOrbis payloads + Kernel Exploit implementation by Specter (Cryogenic)
Added 5.55 exploit host support.
